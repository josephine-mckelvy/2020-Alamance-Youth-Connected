## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **+c Insert** button to insert code chunks (or functions). Add documentation outside of the code chunks as reminders of what your code does.

When you click the **Knit** button, it compiles all of the code chunks and generates a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Use the **gear** icon to adjust settings (e.g., "show output only") for each code chunk. 

The shortcut key for "<-" is ALT + [dash] 
CTRL + ENTER will run the highlighted line(s) of code.
The hashtag is code that is commented out.

# 1. Find/Set the working directory, where you'll import/export files.
```{r}
getwd() 
# Wherever this code is saved, the file(s) for your dataset(s) should be there too
```
# 2. Name & import your data frame, or set of information (like a .csv file of survey responses), as factor variables.
- I created a dataframe object (which I named "raw.df") for each dataset that will read in the respective .csv files and convert categorical variables into factor variables. (Copy and paste the name of the file. There's a hidden character in the SurveyMonkey exports.)
```{r}
raw.df <- read.csv("Participant Pre-  Post-Test Survey.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Export .CSV from your survey platform and confirm numeric values, NOT choice text. 

# Clean variable names in advance (e.g., insert a row of Q#s). Do NOT start variable names with numbers.
```
# 3. Clean the analytic dataset.
- I created an analytic dataset (which I named "ppt.df") that will select/subset the data columns and remove informational header rows that are not survey responses.

(**1-based index**: R starts with the first row of obs. being "1"; 2:nrow means that your responses/obs. start on row 3 until the Nth row. Check your dataset to see which row the actual observations start.)
```{r}
ppt.df <- raw.df[2:nrow(raw.df),c(12:67,75:113)] #11 obs, 95 variables
# Confirm the number of obs and variables.

- Recode missing data:
```{r}
ppt.df[ppt.df==""] <- NA
```
#3a. Clean the dichotomous (CATA/MRdum) variables: 
- Create an object (called "cleanIt") that performs a function to a vector, which serves as a placeholder for something like a column. In that function, convert the vector to a character variable. You have to convert this factor variable to a character variable first because you may see two types of labels (e.g., "1" and "NA"), but there could be more than 2 hidden levels in your factor variable. Where the variable is "NA" or a blank, replace with zero (0). Then convert the vector to a numeric variable that can be summed.
```{r}
# SurveyMonkey Quirk: Even though each check in "Check all that apply" (multiple response dummies) is dichotomous or binary (i.e., zeroes and ones), selecting the "none of the above" or "prefer not to answer" option/column is marked as "zero". Also, the 4th option/column, if checked, is marked as "four". With dummy variables, zero = "no" and one = "yes", which helps with summing each option. The function below converts the CATA/MR into dummy variables. But sometimes, zero means yes. So convert those "yeses" to one. Then convert remaining blanks to zero

#cleanIt <- function(vec){
#  chars <- as.character(vec)
#  chars[is.na(chars)] <- "0"
#  chars[chars==""] <- "0"
#  chars[chars!="0"] <- "1"
#  return(as.numeric(chars))
#}

cleanIt <- function(vec){
  chars <- as.character(vec)
  chars[chars!=""] <- "1" #if not blank (including zeroes), replace with "one"
  chars[is.na(chars)] <- "0" #if missing, replace with zero
  chars[chars==""] <- "0" #if blank, replace with zero
  return(as.numeric(chars)) #convert values to numbers
}
```
- Use list apply (lapply) to repeat the "cleanIt" function to those columns, i.e., your vectors.  
```{r}
ppt.df[7:11] <- lapply(ppt.df[7:11], cleanIt) #racial identity options
ppt.df[16:20] <- lapply(ppt.df[16:20], cleanIt) #gender identity options
ppt.df[30:43] <- lapply(ppt.df[30:43], cleanIt) #last time sex options

ppt.df[64:81] <- lapply(ppt.df[64:81], cleanIt) #if used correctly Qs
```
# 3b. Clean the nominal (categorical, ordinal) variables:
- For each multiple choice statement, change the response values to factor, specify levels, and rename the value labels, based on the survey/codebook: (open both the dataset and the codebook/survey with question numbers and recode values to make sure the labels and levels are correct)
```{r}

# 3c. Convert continuous variables from factor to numeric:
(Factor variables are stored as integer codes--not numeric value--to create levels (e.g., responses ranging from 10 to 12 are three levels). (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6328771/changing-values-when-converting-column-type-to-numeric; https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-factor-to-numeric-and-numeric-to-factor-in-r-programming/) Convert the variable from factor to character (e.g., a ten) and then to numeric.)
```{r}
# Example:
# ta.df$minutes <- as.numeric(as.character(ta.df$Q5))

# Optional: Convert to hours
# ta.df$hours <- ta.df$minutes/60
```
# 3d. Reverse-coded columns/variables:
https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/easy-reverse-code/

Convert the factor variable to numeric so that you can subtract it from a value to reverse code that value
```{r}
# Example:
# ppt.df$`I felt judged` <- as.numeric(as.character(ppt.df$`I felt judged`))
# ppt.df$`I felt judged` <- 4-ppt.df$`I felt judged` # on an ordered scale of 1 to 3
```

# Optional: select the 1st through 3rd columns/variables and start them with Q and separate them with a space
# myvars <- paste("Q", 1:3, sep="")
# newdata <- mydata[myvars]
# or only columns/variables 1 and 5 through 10
# newdata <- mydata[c(1,5:10)]

# subset all rows/observations that have a column/variable value of greater than or equal to 20 OR less than 10, keeping the column/variables that are named.
# newdata <- subset(mydata, age >= 20 | age < 10,
# select=c(ID, Weight))

# subset all men over the age of 25, keeping columns/variables weight, income and all columns/variables between them).
# newdata <- subset(mydata, sex=="m" & age > 25,
# select=weight:income)
