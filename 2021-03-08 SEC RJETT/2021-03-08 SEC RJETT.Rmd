## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **+c Insert** button to insert code chunks (or functions). Add documentation outside of the code chunks as reminders of what your code does.

When you click the **Knit** button, it compiles all of the code chunks and generates a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Use the **gear** icon to adjust settings (e.g., "show output only") for each code chunk. 

The shortcut key for "<-" is ALT + [dash] 
CTRL + ENTER will run the highlighted line(s) of code.
The hashtag is code that is commented out.

# 1. Find/Set the working directory, where you'll import/export files.
```{r}
getwd() 
# Wherever this code is saved, the file(s) for your dataset(s) should be there too
```
# 2. Name & import your data frame, or set of information (like a .csv file of survey responses), as factor variables.
- I created a dataframe object (which I named "raw.df") for each dataset that will read in the respective .csv files and convert categorical variables into factor variables. (Copy and paste the name of the file.)
```{r}
raw.df <- read.csv("SEC RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY TASK TEAM ORGANIZATION ASSESSMENT.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Export .CSV from your survey platform and confirm numeric values, NOT choice text. 
```
# 3. Clean the analytic dataset.
- I created an analytic dataset (which I named "ppt.df") that will select/subset the data columns and remove informational header rows that are not survey responses.

(**1-based index**: R starts with the first row of obs. being "1"; 2:nrow means that your responses/obs. start on row 3 until the Nth row. Check your dataset to see which row the actual observations start.)
```{r}
secrjett.df <- raw.df[2:nrow(raw.df),c(10:18)] #5 obs of 9 variables
# Confrm the number of obs and variables.

names(secrjett.df) <- c("Courageous leadership to navigate uncomfortable situations",
                   "Change the culture when BIPOC folks are expected to assimilate to white culture",
                   "Encourage conversations about racial justice at all levels",
                   "Center racial justice across all programs with the groups we work with",
                   "Center BIPOC folks within the community in regular programming",
                   "Advocate for racial justice in advisory groups",
                   "Prioritize the participation of BIPOC-led groups",
                   "Provide Training/TA in the first language of participants",
                   "Racial justice is a guiding principle in program development and QA")
```
- Recode missing data:
```{r}
secrjett.df[secrjett.df==""] <- NA
secrjett.df[secrjett.df=="6"] <- NA
```
# 3a. Clean the nominal (categorical, ordinal) variables:
- For each multiple choice statement, change the response values to factor, specify levels, and rename the value labels, based on the survey/codebook: (open both the dataset and the codebook/survey with question numbers and recode values to make sure the labels and levels are correct)
```{r}
