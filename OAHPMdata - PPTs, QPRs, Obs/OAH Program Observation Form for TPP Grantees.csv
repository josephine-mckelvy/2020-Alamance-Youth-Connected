This could make keeping attendance, fidelity, and make up lessons difficult to keep track of.   - Seemed rushed at times, maybe try and find a longer time period where all activities in module can be taught at same time.  ",- Great job at validating participant's feelings and needs  - Very engaged and active group  - Facilitator was great at engaging young people ,- Suggest having an anonymous question box available  - Suggest posting group guidelines  - Suggest changing gendered language in curriculum in order to be more inclusive.

Timing was excellent. ,Facilitators also successfully implemented the supplemental lesson on consent: Tell me how you Like it.

This is a technical issue and one that will be resolved when we are all in person again.     I did notice some time management challenges that can be easily fixed. ",Strong rapport with the students,"Maybe play music while students work in pairs or in groups, liked the timer going off (great idea!), asked students to pass around handouts which got them involved, liked that the students had fidget toys, and I enjoyed watching Mr. Turner teach! Looks like it is going well :)"
