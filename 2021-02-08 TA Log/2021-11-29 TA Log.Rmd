## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **+c Insert** button to insert code chunks (or functions). Add documentation outside of the code chunks as reminders of what your code does.

When you click the **Knit** button, it compiles all of the code chunks and generates a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Use the **gear** icon to adjust settings (e.g., "show output only") for each code chunk. 

The shortcut key for "<-" is ALT + [dash] 
CTRL + ENTER will run the highlighted line(s) of code.
The hashtag is code that is commented out.

# 1. Find/Set the working directory, where you'll import/export files.
```{r}
getwd() 
# Wherever this code is saved, the file(s) for your dataset(s) should be there too
```
# 2. Name & import your data frame, or set of information (like a .csv file of survey responses), as factor variables.
- I created a dataframe object (which I named "raw.df") for each dataset that will read in the respective .csv files and convert categorical variables into factor variables. (Copy and paste the name of the file. There's a hidden character in the SurveyMonkey exports.)
```{r}
rawio.df <- read.csv("AYCÂ TA Log 2020-2023.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
rawcl.df <- read.csv("AYC QI TTA Log 2020-2023.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE) 

# Export .CSV from your survey platform and confirm numeric values, NOT choice text. 

# Clean variable names in advance (e.g., insert a row of Q#s). Do NOT start variable names with numbers.
```
# 3. Clean the analytic dataset.
- I created an analytic dataset for clinics (which I named "tacl.df") and one for IOs (which I named "taio.df") that will subset the data columns and remove informational header rows that are not survey responses.

(**1-based index**: R starts with the first row of obs. being "1"; 3:nrow means that your responses/obs. start on row 4 until the Nth row. Check your dataset to see which row the actual observations start.)
```{r}
tacl.df <- rawcl.df[2:nrow(rawcl.df),c(10,12:19)]

```
# 3a. Clean the nominal (categorical, dichotomous/MRdum, ordinal/Likert) variables.
- For each multiple choice statement, change the response values to factor, specify levels, and rename the value labels for each level, based on the survey/codebook: (open both the dataset and the codebook/survey with question numbers and recode values to make sure the labels and levels are correct)
```{r}
labelspec <- c("Lisa Garland",
               "Caro Welker",
               "Josephine McKelvy",
               "Sophia Durant",

               "Web-based for multiple organizations")

tacl.df$`Trainer/TA Provider` <- factor(tacl.df$`Trainer/TA Provider`,
                   levels = c(1),
                   labels = c("Sophia Durant"))

                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
                   labels = labelspec)

tacl.df$`Training/TA` <- factor(tacl.df$`Training/TA`,
                   levels = c(1,2),
                   labels = labeltta)
taio.df$`Training/TA` <- factor(taio.df$`Training/TA`,
                   levels = c(1,2),
                   labels = labeltta)

tacl.df$`Mode of T/TA` <- factor(tacl.df$`Mode of T/TA`,
                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = labelmode)
taio.df$`Mode of T/TA` <- factor(taio.df$`Mode of T/TA`,

```
- Create an object (called "cleanIt") that performs a function to a vector, which serves as a placeholder for something like a column. In that function, convert the vector to a character variable. You have to convert this factor variable to a character variable first because you may see two types of labels (e.g., "1" and "NA"), but there could be more than 2 hidden levels in your factor variable. Where the variable is "NA" or a blank, replace with zero (0). Then convert the vector to a numeric variable that can be summed.
```{r}
cleanIt <- function(vec){
  chars <- as.character(vec)
  chars[is.na(chars)] <- "0"
  chars[chars==""] <- "0"
  chars[chars!="0"] <- "1"
  return(as.numeric(chars))
}
```
- There is a multiple-response item/column with varying numbers of options for each clinic partner (i.e., columns 6-9 of the tacl.df) and each implementing organization (IO) (i.e., columns 7-17 of the taio.df). Use list apply (lapply) to repeat the "cleanIt" function to those columns (i.e., your vectors).  
```{r}
tacl.df[6:9]   <- lapply(tacl.df[6:9], cleanIt) # clinic partners
taio.df[6:16]  <- lapply(taio.df[6:16], cleanIt) # IOs
taio.df[19:28] <- lapply(taio.df[19:28], cleanIt) # GTO steps
#ta.df[62:83] <- lapply(ta.df[62:83], cleanIt) # training topics for the old dataframe
```
- Create a categorical variable (i.e., mainio) in a dataframe (i.e., taio.df) out of the check-all-that-apply (multiple-response dummies) for IOs (i.e, columns 6 thru 16) across the row/case (i.e., margin of 1). Return the name of the column (i.e., the IO). If more than one IO applied (or the sum of the check-all-that-apply > 1), return "Multiple IOs". Name the variable/IO itself IF the variable was not zero (or "No" to any of those that could apply).
```{r}
taio.df$mainio <- apply(taio.df[6:16], 1, function(x) {ifelse(sum(x) > 1, "Multiple IOs", names(x[x != 0]))})

#If only one IO applied (e.g., 1:1 TA), create a variable (i.e., setting) that re-categorizes the IO into its setting served: Clinic, Foster Care, Community, Higher Ed, or Multiple IOs (probably training). Then factor that variable.
taio.df$setting <- ifelse(taio.df$mainio %in% c("ACHD"), 1, #ACHD = Clinic
           ifelse(taio.df$mainio %in% c("ACDSS"), 2, #ACDSS = Foster Care
           ifelse(taio.df$mainio %in% c("CHS","CGDC","CrossRoads","PAYC","Exchange","FAS","SABGC"), 3, #CHS, CGDC, CrossRoads, PAYC, Exchange, FAS, SABGC = Community
           ifelse(taio.df$mainio %in% c("Elon"), 4, #Elon = Higher Ed
           ifelse(taio.df$mainio %in% c("Multiple IOs"), 5, NA)))))

taio.df$setting <- factor(taio.df$setting,
                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("Clinic TA","Foster Care TA","Community TA","Higher Ed TA","Multi-setting (training?)"))

#mertsetting <- data.frame(table(ta.df$setting))
#names(mertsetting) <- c("Setting","Count") #counted logs submitted

#library(sjPlot)
#tab_df(mertsetting,
#       title = "TTA logs for AYC",
#       file = "MERT - TTA Logs Table.doc")
#tab_xtab(var.row = ta.df$setting, var.col = ta.df$Mode.of.Training.or.TA,
#         title = "TTA logs by mode",
#         file = "MERT - TTA Mode Table.doc")

```
# 3b. Convert column/variable to "date" class (%m = 2-digit month; %d = 2-digit day; %[capital]Y = 4-digit year)(https://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html; https://www.statology.org/subset-by-date-range-in-r/)

tacl.df$`Date of T/TA` <- as.Date(tacl.df$`Date of T/TA`,"%m/%d/%Y")
taio.df$`Date of T/TA` <- as.Date(taio.df$`Date of T/TA`,"%m/%d/%Y")
```
# 3c. Convert continuous variables from factor to numeric.
(Factor variables are stored as integer codes--not numeric value--to create levels (e.g., responses ranging from 10 to 12 are three levels). Skipping "as.character" will save the level, not the label, as the value.
