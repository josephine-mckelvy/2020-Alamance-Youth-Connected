## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **+c Insert** button to insert code chunks (or functions). Add documentation outside of the code chunks as reminders of what your code does.

When you click the **Knit** button, it compiles all of the code chunks and generates a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Use the **gear** icon to adjust settings (e.g., "show output only") for each code chunk. 

The shortcut key for "<-" is ALT + [dash] 
CTRL + ENTER will run the highlighted line(s) of code.
The hashtag is code that is commented out.

# 1. Find/Set the working directory, where you'll import/export files.
```{r}
getwd() 
# Wherever this code is saved, the file(s) for your dataset(s) should be there too
```
# 2. Name & import your data frame, or set of information (like a .csv file of survey responses), as factor variables.
- I created a dataframe object (which I named "raw.df") for each dataset that will read in the respective .csv files and convert categorical variables into factor variables. (Copy and paste the name of the file. There's a hidden character in the SurveyMonkey exports.)
```{r}
raw.df <- read.csv("AYCÂ TA Log 2020-2023.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Export .CSV from your survey platform and confirm numeric values, NOT choice text. 

# Clean variable names in advance (e.g., insert a row of Q#s). Do NOT start variable names with numbers.
```
# 3. Clean the analytic dataset.
- I created an analytic dataset (which I named "ta.df") that will subset the data and remove informational header rows that are not survey responses.

(**1-based index**: R starts with the first row of obs. being "1"; 3:nrow means that your responses/obs. start on row 4 until the Nth row. Check your dataset to see which row the actual observations start.)
```{r}
ta.df <- raw.df[2:nrow(raw.df),] 
# Confirm the number of obs and 85 variables on SurveyMonkey.
```
- Recode missing data:
```{r}
ta.df[ta.df==""] <- NA
ta.df[ta.df=="N/A"] <- NA
```
# 3a. Clean the nominal (categorical, dichotomous/MRdum, ordinal) variables.
- For each multiple choice statement, change the response values to factor, specify levels, and rename the value labels, based on the survey/codebook: (open both the dataset and the codebook/survey with question numbers and recode values to make sure the labels and levels are correct)
```{r}

ta.df$Program.Specialist.TA.Provider.Name <- factor(ta.df$Program.Specialist.TA.Provider.Name,
                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
                   labels = labelspec)

                   levels = c(1,2),
                   labels = labeltta)
ta.df$Mode.of.Training.or.TA <- factor(ta.df$Mode.of.Training.or.TA,

# 3b. Convert continuous variables from factor to numeric.
(Factor variables are stored as integer codes--not numeric value--to create levels (e.g., responses ranging from 10 to 12 are three levels). Skipping "as.character" will save the level, not the label, as the value.
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6328771/changing-values-when-converting-column-type-to-numeric; https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-factor-to-numeric-and-numeric-to-factor-in-r-programming/) Convert to character and then numeric.)
```{r}
ta.df$How.many.adults.attended.this.training. <- as.numeric(as.character(ta.df$How.many.adults.attended.this.training.))
sum(ta.df$How.many.adults.attended.this.training.) #will contain duplicates and across time; see M:\...\Facilitator Roster instead

ta.df$X.10 <- as.numeric(as.character(ta.df$X.10))

ta.df$Length.of.Training.or.TA <- as.numeric(as.character(ta.df$Length.of.Training.or.TA))
#Optional: Convert to hours
ta.df$hours <- ta.df$Length.of.Training.or.TA/60
```
- Reverse-coded columns/variables:
https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/easy-reverse-code/

Convert the factor variable to numeric so that you can subtract it from a value to reverse code that value
```{r}
# Example:
# chrsap.df$Q2.1_3 <- as.numeric(as.character(chrsap.df$Q2.1_3))
# chrsap.df$Q2.1_3 <- 8-chrsap.df$Q2.1_3 #on a scale of 1 to 7
```
- Compute frequencies and percentages for each response category for each question.
```{r}
#mrdumdisc <- data.frame(Freq=colSums(ta.df[17:25]),
#                  Pct.of.Answ = (colSums(ta.df[17:25])/sum(ta.df[17:25]))*100,
#                  Pct.of.Case = (colSums(ta.df[17:25])/nrow(ta.df[17:25]))*100)
```
- Create an object (called "cleanIt") that performs a function to a vector, which serves as a placeholder for something like a column. In that function, convert the vector to a character variable. You have to convert this factor variable to a character variable first because you may see two types of labels (e.g., "1" and "NA"), but there could be more than 2 hidden levels in your factor variable. Where the variable is "NA" or a blank, replace with zero (0). Then convert the vector to a numeric variable that can be summed.
```{r}
cleanIt <- function(vec){
  chars <- as.character(vec)
  chars[is.na(chars)] <- "0"
  chars[chars==""] <- "0"
  chars[chars!="0"] <- "1"
  return(as.numeric(chars))
}
```
- There is a multiple-response item/column with varying numbers of options for each implementing organization (IO): columns 16-25 of the ta.df. Use list apply (lapply) to repeat the "cleanIt" function to those columns, i.e., your vectors.  
```{r}
ta.df[16:26] <- lapply(ta.df[16:26], cleanIt) # IOs
ta.df[31:61] <- lapply(ta.df[31:61], cleanIt) # GTO
ta.df[62:83] <- lapply(ta.df[62:83], cleanIt) # training topics

#If more than one applied, then sum > 1, or "Multiple"
ta.df$mainio <- apply(ta.df[16:26], 1, function(x) {ifelse(sum(x) > 1, "Multiple settings", names(x[x != 0]))})

ta.df$mainio <- ifelse(ta.df$mainio %in% c("X.1"),"ACHD",

                ifelse(ta.df$mainio %in% c("Multiple settings"),"Multiple settings",NA)))))))))))
