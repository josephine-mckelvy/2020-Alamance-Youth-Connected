## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **+c Insert** button to insert code chunks (or functions). Add documentation outside of the code chunks as reminders of what your code does.

When you click the **Knit** button, it compiles all of the code chunks and generates a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Use the **gear** icon to adjust settings (e.g., "show output only") for each code chunk. 

The shortcut key for "<-" is ALT + [dash] 
CTRL + ENTER will run the highlighted line(s) of code.
The hashtag is code that is commented out.

# 1. Find/Set the working directory, where you'll import/export files.
```{r}
getwd() 
# Wherever this code is saved, the file(s) for your dataset(s) should be there too
```
# 2. Name & import your data frame, or set of information (like a .csv file of survey responses), as factor variables.
- I created a dataframe object (which I named "raw.df") for each dataset that will read in the respective .csv files and convert categorical variables into factor variables. (Copy and paste the name of the file. There's a hidden character in the SurveyMonkey exports.)
```{r}
raw.df <- read.csv("AYCÂ TA Log 2020-2021.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Export .CSV from your survey platform and confirm numeric values, NOT choice text. 

# Clean variable names in advance (e.g., insert a row of Q#s). Do NOT start variable names with numbers.
```
# 3. Clean the analytic dataset.
- I created an analytic dataset (which I named "ta.df") that will subset the data and remove informational header rows that are not survey responses.

(**1-based index**: R starts with the first row of obs. being "1"; 3:nrow means that your responses/obs. start on row 4 until the Nth row. Check your dataset to see which row the actual observations start.)
```{r}
ta.df <- raw.df[3:nrow(raw.df),] #17 obs
# Confirm the number of obs and variables.
```
- Recode missing data:
```{r}
ta.df[ta.df==""] <- NA
```
# 3a. Clean the nominal (categorical, dichotomous/MRdum, ordinal) variables.
- For each multiple choice statement, change the response values to factor, specify levels, and rename the value labels, based on the survey/codebook: (open both the dataset and the codebook/survey with question numbers and recode values to make sure the labels and levels are correct)
```{r}
labelspec <- c("Lisa Garland",
               "Caro Welker",
               "Josephine McKelvy",
               "Sophia Durant",
               "Other")
labeltta <- c("Training",
              "Technical Assistance")
labelmode <- c("Phone",
               "Web-based for one organization",
               "In-person for one organization",
               "In-person for multiple organizations",
               "Web-based for multiple organizations")
labelorg <- c("Alamance Achieves",
              "Alamance County Health Dept",
              "CityGate Dream Center",
              "CrossRoads",
              "Alamance County Dept of Social Srvs",
              "Children's Home Society",
              "Positive Attitude Youth Center",
              "Elon University",
              "Exchange Club",
              "Salvation Army Boys & Girls Club")

ta.df$Q1 <- factor(ta.df$Q1,
                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = labelspec)
ta.df$Q3 <- factor(ta.df$Q3,
                   levels = c(1,2),
                   labels = labeltta)
ta.df$Q6 <- factor(ta.df$Q6,
                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = labelmode)
```
- Reverse-coded columns/variables:
https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/easy-reverse-code/

Convert the factor variable to numeric so that you can subtract it from a value to reverse code that value
```{r}
# Example:
# chrsap.df$Q2.1_3 <- as.numeric(as.character(chrsap.df$Q2.1_3))
# chrsap.df$Q2.1_3 <- 8-chrsap.df$Q2.1_3 #on a scale of 1 to 7
```
- Create an object (called "cleanIt") that performs a function to a vector, which serves as a placeholder for something like a column. In that function, convert the vector to a character variable. You have to convert this factor variable to a character variable first because you may see two types of labels (e.g., "1" and "NA"), but there could be more than 2 hidden levels in your factor variable. Where the variable is "NA" or a blank, replace with zero (0). Then convert the vector to a numeric variable that can be summed.
```{r}
cleanIt <- function(vec){
  chars <- as.character(vec)
  chars[is.na(chars)] <- "0"
  chars[chars==""] <- "0"
  return(as.numeric(chars))
}
```
- There is a multiple-response item/column with varying numbers of options for each implementing organization (IO): columns 16-25 of the ta.df. Use list apply (lapply) to repeat the "cleanIt" function to those columns, i.e., your vectors.  
```{r}
ta.df[16:25] <- lapply(ta.df[16:25], cleanIt)
```
- Compute frequencies and percentages for each response category for each question.
```{r}
mrdumdisc <- data.frame(Freq=colSums(ta.df[16:25]),
                  Pct.of.Answ = (colSums(ta.df[16:25])/sum(ta.df[16:25]))*100,
                  Pct.of.Case = (colSums(ta.df[16:25])/nrow(ta.df[16:25]))*100)

# Plot and save bar charts for these percentages of cases/obs.
# library(ggplot2)
```
# 3e. Convert continuous variables from factor to numeric.
(Factor variables are stored as integer codes--not numeric value--to create levels (e.g., responses ranging from 10 to 12 are three levels). Convert to character and then numeric.)
```{r}
ta.df$adult <- as.numeric(as.character(ta.df$Q17))
sum(ta.df$adult)

ta.df$minutes <- as.numeric(as.character(ta.df$Q5))
#Optional: Convert to hours
ta.df$hours <- ta.df$minutes/60
```
# 4. Subset data by date ranges (e.g., quarters)
```{r}
# Convert column/variable to "date" class (%m = 2-digit month; %d = 2-digit day; %[capital]Y = 4-digit year)
ta.df$Q4 <- as.Date(ta.df$Q4,"%m/%d/%Y")

# Subset data between two dates, inclusive
# qtr1 <- ta.df[ta.df$Q4 >="2020-07-01" & ta.df$Q4 <="2020-09-30",]
qtr2 <- ta.df[ta.df$Q4 >="2020-10-01" & ta.df$Q4 <="2020-12-31",]
qtr3 <- ta.df[ta.df$Q4 >="2021-01-01" & ta.df$Q4 <="2021-03-31",]
# qtr4 <- ta.df[ta.df$Q4 >="2021-04-01" & ta.df$Q4 <="2021-06-30",]
```
- How many adults (from IOs, CAG) were trained this quarter (by T vs TA)?
```{r}

aggregate(x= qtr2$adult,
          by= list(qtr2$Q3),
          FUN=sum)

aggregate(x = qtr3$adult,
          by= list(qtr3$Q3),
          FUN=sum)
```
- How many hours of T/TA were provided this quarter?
```{r}
aggregate(x=qtr2$hours,
          by= list(qtr2$Q3),
          FUN=sum)

aggregate(x=qtr3$hours,
          by= list(qtr3$Q3),
          FUN=sum)
```
