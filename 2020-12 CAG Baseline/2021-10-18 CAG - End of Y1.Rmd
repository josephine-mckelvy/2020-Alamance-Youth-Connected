## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **+c Insert** button to insert code chunks (or functions). Add documentation outside of the code chunks as reminders of what your code does.

When you click the **Knit** button, it compiles all of the code chunks and generates a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Use the **gear** icon to adjust settings (e.g., "show output only") for each code chunk. 

The shortcut key for "<-" is ALT + [dash] 
CTRL + ENTER will run the highlighted line(s) of code.
The hashtag is code that is commented out.

#1. Find/Set the working directory, where you'll import/export files.
```{r}
getwd() 
# Wherever this code is saved, the file(s) for your dataset(s) should be there too
```
#2. Name & import your data frame, or set of information (like a .csv file of survey responses), as factor variables.
- I created a dataframe object (which I named "raw.df") for each dataset that will read in the respective .csv files and convert categorical variables into factor variables.
```{r}
raw.df <- read.csv("2021-10-08 CAG Experience Survey (end of YR1).csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Export numeric values, NOT choice text, from your survey platform. 

# Optional: Clean variable names in advance (e.g., insert a row of Q#s). Do NOT start variable names with numbers.
```
- create a time variable with standardized dates
```{r}
raw.df$Start <- as.Date(raw.df$Start.Date, "%m/%d/%Y", tz="America/New_York") 
```
#3. Clean the dataset.
- I created an analytic dataset (which I named "cag.df") that will subset the columns of usable variables and remove informational header rows that are not survey responses.

(**1-based index**: R starts with the first row of obs. being "1"; 2:nrow means that your responses/obs. start on row 3 until the Nth row. Check your dataset to see which row the actual observations start.)

- I renamed the columns of variables in the analytic dataset for the diverging bar charts.
```{r}
cag.df <- raw.df[2:nrow(raw.df),c(55,10,12:29,31:54)] 
# Confirm the number of obs and 54+1 variables in SurveyMonkey.

```
#3a. Clean the nominal (dichotomous, categorical) variables.
- For each multiple choice statement, change the response values to factor, specify levels, and rename the value labels, based on the survey/codebook: (open both the dataset and the codebook/survey with question numbers and recode values to make sure the labels and levels are correct)
