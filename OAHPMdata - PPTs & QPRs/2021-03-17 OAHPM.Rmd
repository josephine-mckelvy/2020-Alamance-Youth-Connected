## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **+c Insert** button to insert code chunks (or functions). Add documentation outside of the code chunks as reminders of what your code does.

When you click the **Knit** button, it compiles all of the code chunks and generates a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Use the **gear** icon to adjust settings (e.g., "show output only") for each code chunk. 

The shortcut key for "<-" is ALT + [dash] 
CTRL + ENTER will run the highlighted line(s) of code.
The hashtag is documentation/explanation that is commented out.

# 0. First time: 
- Create a new project with version control (Git) on the top right corner. 
# 0. Every time: 
- Select your existing project. Pull any changes from GitHub, using the Git tab in the Environment panel/window.
- Copy the template .rmd into a project folder and upload the dataset.
# 0. Analog prep (first time):
- have a copy of the survey with question numbers and recode values of every closed-ended answer choice--your codebook
- log into oahpmdata.net to see what data you'll need to report (and how) to OPA

# 1. Find/Set the working directory, where you'll import/export files.
```{r}
getwd() 
# Wherever this code is saved, the file(s) for your dataset(s) should be there too
```
# 2. Name & import your data frame, or set of information (like a .csv file of survey responses), as factor variables.
- I created a dataframe object (which I named "raw.df") for each dataset that will read in the respective .csv files and convert categorical variables into factor variables. 
```{r}
rawppt.df <- read.csv("Participant Pre-  Post-Test Survey.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
rawflqpr.df <- read.csv("Facilitators Evaluation Tools.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
rawobs.df <- read.csv("OAH Program Observation Form for TPP Grantees.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
# Export .CSV from your survey platform and confirm numeric values, NOT choice text. 
# Make sure filters are turned on or off. 
```
# 3. Clean the analytic dataset.
- I created analytic datasets ("ppt.df" for the pre/post test, "flqpr.df" for the fidelity logs and quarterly program reports) that will select/subset the data columns and remove informational header rows that are not survey responses.
- **1-based index**: R starts with the first row of obs. being "1"; 2:nrow means that your responses/obs. start on row 3 until the Nth row. Check your dataset to see which row the actual observations start.)
```{r}
ppt.df <- rawppt.df[2:nrow(rawppt.df),c(12:69,77:115)] #97 variables
pre.df <- rawppt.df[2:nrow(rawobs.df),c(12:57,79:115)] #optional subset of demographics, pre-test
post.df <- rawppt.df[2:nrow(rawobs.df),c(12:14,58:69,77:115)]# optional subset of identifiers, satisfaction, contact info to post-test
flqpr.df <- rawflqpr.df[2:nrow(rawflqpr.df),c(10:30,32:36,38:47,49:53,55:64,66:70,72:81,83:87,89:93,95:99,101:106,114:132,134:145,147:158,160:174)] #145 variables
obs.df <- rawobs.df[2:nrow(rawobs.df),c(11,21:23,34)]

# Confirm the number of obs and variables in the environment with the survey codebooks.

# Rename the variables/columns:

#3a. Clean the dichotomous (CATA/MRdum) variables: 
- Create an object (called "cleanIt") that performs a function to a vector, which serves as a placeholder for something like a column. In that function, convert the vector to a character variable. You have to convert this factor variable to a character variable first because you may see two types of labels (e.g., "1" and "NA"), but there could be more than 2 hidden levels in your factor variable. Where the variable is "NA" or a blank, replace with zero (0). Then convert the vector to a numeric variable that can be summed.
```{r}
# SurveyMonkey Quirk: Even though each check in "Check all that apply" (multiple response dummies) is dichotomous or binary (i.e., zeroes and ones), selecting the "none of the above" or "prefer not to answer" option/column is marked as "zero". Also, the 4th option/column, if checked, is marked as "four". With dummy variables, zero = "no" and one = "yes", which helps with summing each option. The function below converts the CATA/MR into dummy variables. But sometimes, zero means yes. So convert those "yeses" to one. Then convert remaining blanks to zero

cleanIt <- function(vec){
  chars <- as.character(vec)
  chars[chars!=""] <- "1" #if not blank (including zeroes), replace with "one"
  chars[is.na(chars)] <- "0" #if missing, replace with zero
  chars[chars==""] <- "0" #if blank, replace with zero
  return(as.numeric(chars)) #convert values to numbers
}
```
- Use list apply (lapply) to repeat the "cleanIt" function to those columns, i.e., your vectors.  
```{r}
#Pre/Post Tests
ppt.df[8:13] <- lapply(ppt.df[8:13], cleanIt) #pre: racial identity options
ppt.df[18:22] <- lapply(ppt.df[18:22], cleanIt) #pre: gender identity options
ppt.df[32:45] <- lapply(ppt.df[32:45], cleanIt) #pre: last time sex options
ppt.df[66:83] <- lapply(ppt.df[66:83], cleanIt) #both: if used correctly Qs

#Quarterly Program Report
flqpr.df[102:106] <- lapply(flqpr.df[102:106], cleanIt) #QPR1 eval
flqpr.df[114:118] <- lapply(flqpr.df[114:118], cleanIt) #QPR2 eval
flqpr.df[126:130] <- lapply(flqpr.df[126:130], cleanIt) #QPR3 eval
flqpr.df[138:142] <- lapply(flqpr.df[138:142], cleanIt) #QPR4 eval
```
# 3b. Clean the nominal (categorical, ordinal) variables:
- For each multiple choice statement, change the response values to factor, specify sequence & values of levels, and rename the value labels, based on the survey/codebook. (Open both the dataset and the codebook/survey with question numbers and recode values to make sure the labels and levels are correct.)
- Optional: name the sets of labels for each categorical response that you'll reuse
