This is a technical issue and one that will be resolved when we are all in person again.     I did notice some time management challenges that can be easily fixed. ",Strong rapport with the students,"Maybe play music while students work in pairs or in groups, liked the timer going off (great idea!), asked students to pass around handouts which got them involved, liked that the students had fidget toys, and I enjoyed watching Mr. Turner teach! Looks like it is going well :)"
